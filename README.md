Project 8:  Dockerized CI/CD Pipeline with Azure DevOps
Objective: Build a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps to automate the deployment of Dockerized applications.

Solution Steps:

Set Up Azure DevOps: Create a new project in Azure DevOps and configure the necessary permissions and settings. Initialize a Git repository within the project to store your application code and Docker configurations.

Create Dockerized Application: Develop a sample web application or choose an existing application to containerize with Docker. Write a Docker file to define the application's environment and dependencies.

Containerize Application with Docker: Build a Docker image for your application using the Dockerfile. Test the Docker image locally to ensure it runs as expected within a container environment.

Push Docker Image to Registry: Set up a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry) to store your Docker images. Push the built Docker image to the registry to make it available for deployment.

Configure CI Pipeline in Azure DevOps: Create a CI pipeline in Azure DevOps to automate the build process of your Dockerized application. Configure the pipeline to trigger whenever changes are pushed to the Git repository.

Build Docker Image in CI Pipeline: Define build tasks in the CI pipeline to build the Docker image from the application source code and Dockerfile. Use Docker command-line tools or Docker tasks provided by Azure DevOps.

Automate Testing and Quality Checks: Integrate automated tests and quality checks (e.g., unit tests, code analysis) into the CI pipeline to validate the application code before building the Docker image.

Configure CD Release Pipeline: Set up a CD release pipeline in Azure DevOps to automate the deployment of the Dockerized application to your target environment (e.g., Azure Kubernetes Service, Docker Swarm).

Define Deployment Stages: Define deployment stages in the release pipeline to deploy the Docker image to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production). Configure environment-specific variables and settings.

Deploy Docker Image with Kubernetes: If deploying to Kubernetes, use Kubernetes deployment manifests (e.g., YAML files) to define the desired state of the application deployment. Use Kubernetes deployment tasks in Azure DevOps to apply the manifests and deploy the Docker image.

Monitor Deployment and Rollback: Monitor the deployment process in Azure DevOps to track the progress and detect any issues or failures. Implement rollback mechanisms or automated recovery actions in case of deployment failures.

Document and Review: Document the CI/CD pipeline configurations, Docker configurations, and deployment process in Azure DevOps. Conduct a review of the pipeline setup and deployment workflow to identify areas for improvement.
